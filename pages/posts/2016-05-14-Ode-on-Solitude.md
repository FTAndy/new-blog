{% blockquote Alexander Pope , Ode on Solitude%}
Happy the man, whose wish and care
A few paternal acres bound,
Content to breathe his native air,
In his own ground.

Whose herds with milk, whose fields with bread,
Whose flocks supply him with attire,
Whose trees in summer yield him shade,
In winter fire.

Blest! who can unconcern'dly find
Hours, days, and years slide soft away,
In health of body, peace of mind,
Quiet by day,

Sound sleep by night; study and ease
Together mix'd; sweet recreation,
And innocence, which most does please,
With meditation.

Thus let me live, unseen, unknown;
Thus unlamented let me die;
Steal from the world, and not a stone
Tell where I lye.

{% blockquote Alexander Pope , Ode on Solitude%}

耕作着祖辈留下的几亩土地，呼吸着土地上自然的空气
这样的人才能称为快乐的人

牛产牛奶，地长面包
羊毛身上穿
树阴为他留，冬天有柴烧

真是太幸福了
无忧无虑地过着轻松，快活的日子
身体健康，头脑清晰，悄悄过着小日子

睡觉打着鼾，闲时读些书
张弛有度，酣畅淋漓
天真时感到快乐，快乐时又带着沉思

无名，无声地活着
没有遗憾地死去
不留下任何痕迹，悄悄离开这个世界
